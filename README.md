# usedPhones-Project

---

## üìå Overview  
This project was developed as part of a university course at the **University of Thessaly**. It is an application designed for listing and managing used phones. The project was created strictly for educational purposes and is not intended for professional use.  

While it does not follow best coding practices and is not fully developed to professional standards, it served as a valuable learning experience. Through this project, I gained foundational skills in **PHP** and focused primarily on achieving a good academic grade rather than refining it for real-world deployment.

## üöÄ Features  
The application provides the following functionalities:  

- ‚úÖ **User Registration & Authentication**: Users can create an account and complete a simulated email verification process.  
- ‚úÖ **Login System**: Users can log into their accounts after registration.  
- ‚úÖ **Post a Used Phone**: Users can create listings for used phones (currently, image uploads are not supported).

Although the application lacks certain advanced features, it fulfills the basic requirements of a used phone listing system.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Software**  
Download and install the following tools:  

- üîó [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (Includes Apache & MySQL)  
- üîó [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)  
- üîó [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure MySQL & Import Database**  
1. Open **XAMPP** and activate **Apache** and **MySQL**.  
2. Open **MySQL Workbench** and create a new database connection with a name of your choice.  
3. Import the database schema:  
   - Open MySQL Workbench and load `usedphones_schema.mwb`.  
   - Inside the schema, import the SQL files:  
     - `usedphones_phones.sql`  
     - `usedphones_users.sql`  
   - Run the SQL code to apply the structure and data.  
4. (Optional) Verify data by executing:  
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users;
   SELECT * FROM phones;
This step ensures that sample users and phones are available for testing.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure MySQL User**  
1. Click the **Admin** button next to MySQL in XAMPP to open **phpMyAdmin**.  
2. Navigate to the **usedphones** database.  
3. Go to the **Privileges** tab and create a new user:  
   - **Username:** `usedPhonesUser`  
   - **Password:** `123`  
   - **Grant all privileges** to this user.  


### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Project & Run Locally**  
1. Navigate to the XAMPP `htdocs` folder:  
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/xampp/htdocs
2. Open your browser and visit:
   ```sh
   http://localhost/USEDPHONES/usedPhones/

   ### **üîÑ Alternative Setup Using PHP Server in VS Code**  
Instead of using XAMPP, you can run the project directly in **Visual Studio Code**:  

1. Install the **PHP Server** extension in VS Code.  
2. Follow **Step 3** above to configure MySQL and create the database user.  
3. Run the **PHP Server** plugin from VS Code to start the project.
