# usedPhones-Project

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project was developed as part of a university course at the **University of Thessaly**. It is an application designed for listing and managing used phones. The project was created strictly for educational purposes and is not intended for professional use.  

While it does not follow best coding practices and is not fully developed to professional standards, it served as a valuable learning experience. Through this project, I gained foundational skills in **PHP** and focused primarily on achieving a good academic grade rather than refining it for real-world deployment.

## ðŸš€ Features  
The application provides the following functionalities:

- âœ… **Login System**: Users can log into their accounts after registration.  
- âœ… **Post a Used Phone**: Users can create listings for used phones (currently, image uploads are not supported).
